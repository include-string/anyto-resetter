# iMyFone Unlimited Trial Exploit
This script abuses a bug in iMyFone's software to reset the trial period to allow unlimited use.

https://www.imyfone.com/

This project focuses on the "AnyTo" software, allowing iOS users to easily spoof their device locations.

Because trial periods are stored LOCALLY in the registry, this script clears the existing trial data to represent a "new user".

- Project Creation Time: 2 hours
- Time taken to identify bug: ~1 hour

### Output keycodes
- [+] = Success
- [-] = Failure
- [!] = Important
- [SKIP] = Skipped

### Message to iMyFone
Thanks for the free software, I suggest adding some form of online authentication especially since the program requires an active internet connection
